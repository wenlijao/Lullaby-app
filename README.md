# Lullaby-app
This was my first ios app project.
## Story behind it
My friend likes to listen to Harry Potter audio books to help him fall asleep, so for his 29th birthday, I made an app for him to use and play Harry Potter audio books on demand.
## Concept
I invisioned an app that works like Spotify where it has all the basica functionalities for an audio player - play, pause, forward 10 seconds, backward 10 seconds, go to the next chapter and go to the previous chapter. In additional to the basic functionalities, I also wanted to add a sleep timer to set a timer for how long the audio book track should play once it's set.
## Get Started
**Note: Since there are copyright concerns, this app is not on app store, and the audio files that should be in the app to make it work are not uploaded to Github.**

### Software/IDE
I used xcode to develop this project, and it can run a stimulator up for an iphone.
